# WebExtension

Once you start the extension, it will open an empty playlist in new tab. After
that, you can go to other tabs, and if you right click on any YouTube links,
they will be added to the playlist. If you hit play in the playlist tab, once
the first video is ended, it will automatically start the next video. Visit
this page for testing:
